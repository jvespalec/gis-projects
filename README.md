# Cartography Projects

The above projects were completed as part of an Intro to Cartography course, GEOG 370. Each project highlights different aspects of cartographic design, GIS, and data visualization. The projects were created using **ArcGIS Pro**, **Adobe Illustrator**, and various online tools such as Projection Wizard and Mapshaper.

## Lab 1: Vermont Maple Syrup Farms
This was my first design project using ArcGIS Pro. I developed foundational skills with geospatial datasets, adjusting map projections (Projection Wizard), and cartographic generalization (Mapshaper).  

**Challenges:**  
- Ensuring text was legible around lines and polygons (e.g., lake and river labels)  
- Adjusting callouts consistently across the page to ensure a balanced visual hierarchy

## Lab 2: Political Map of Africa: Visualizing European Colonization
The purpose of this map was to show a high level of detail in a small space while maintaining a clean, consistent appearance. I gained more experience in Illustrator, such as using Type on a Path, Lasso, Curvature, and Group Selection tools.  

**Challenges:**  
- Label positioning relative to points of interest:  
  - Too far away, so it was unclear which feature it belonged to  
  - Too close, so it looked cluttered or was overlapping other features  
  - On top of lines, so letters became difficult to read

## Lab 3: Dairy Cow Density in Wisconsin
This project was a choropleth map illustrating the density of dairy cows in Wisconsin counties.  

**Techniques used in ArcGIS Pro:**  
- Data classification  
- Normalization (cows per unit area)  
- Symbology adjustment (choropleth shading)  
- Legend design

## Final Project: The Lasting Effects of Historic Redlining in Milwaukee County
This self-driven project combined all the material covered in the course: cartographic design principles, generalization, map projections, data collection and analysis, ArcGIS Pro, and Adobe Illustrator.  

**Goal:**  
1. Illustrate the relationships between historical redlining boundaries in Milwaukee County and present-day school quality  
2. Visualize how proximity to highly rated schools intersects with historically disadvantaged neighborhoods  

**Data & Methods:**  
- 1938 Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) redlining map of Milwaukee  
- Statewide school report card data from the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction  
- Data cleaning and categorization in Microsoft Excel to create school quality groups (five levels)  
- ArcGIS Pro used for:  
  - Choropleth mapping of redlining zones (A–D)  
  - Symbolization of schools by quality category  
  - Buffer analysis around highly rated schools  
  - Heat/proximity mapping to show accessibility patterns  
- Adobe Illustrator used for final map design and finishing touches  

**Maps Produced:**  
- Choropleth map of original HOLC redlining boundaries with school quality data by district  
- Proximity/heat map showing a lack of accessibility to highly rated schools in relation to redlined areas
